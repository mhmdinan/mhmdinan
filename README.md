## 👋 Hi, I'm Muhammad Inan Imran
I'm a Software Engineer based in Pakistan with a background in Electrical Engineering. I transitioned from hardware to software, starting with Arduino and now I focus on software engineering. I'm passionate about backend development, system design, and machine learning. My tech stack includes FastAPI for backends, and I'm learning frontend with React. I also maintain a homelab with Linux systems and Docker for experimenting with deployments and CI/CD pipelines.

🌍 Based in Pakistan  
🔭 Currently building applications to improve my skills
